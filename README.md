# Pathways viz spike using digraph

### Getting started

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# start react app
npm start
```

Note:
- If we're not able to render custom components using this library (see https://github.com/uber/react-digraph/issues/165), then this library doesn't meet our needs. If it can, then rendering our custom pathway is simple (see demo code in this repo)
